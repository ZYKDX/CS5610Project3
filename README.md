### Project Objective

Online communication has long been a lifestyle for young generation, especially during this pandemic era. <br/>
However, after using a lot of online forums, we find that user backgrounds were often diverse, thus communication<br/>
was ineffective and information less useful. This is mainly due to the large difference in background among users,<br/>
for example, as an MSCS student, after I read an interview experience that was rated as ‘easy’ but found that the author <br/>
is a developer with many years of work experience, the reference value of this post will then become very low immediately.<br/>
Considering this, we plan to build a community site for NEU students and help users communicate with others from a similar <br/>
background. From our perspective, this site will be particularly useful in career development since alumni can communicate smoothly here.!<br/>
